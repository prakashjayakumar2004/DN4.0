# Recursion
Recursion is when a function calls itself to solve a smaller part of the same problem.

### It simplifies problems by:<br>
- Breaking them into smaller parts<br>
- Avoiding loops in many cases

## Time complexity
The time complexity of recursion depends on the number of times the function calls itself. <br>
- If a function calls itself two times then its time complexity is O(2 ^ N). <br>
- if it calls three times then its time complexity is O(3 ^ N) and so on.

## How to Optimize Recursion?
Recursion can be slow if it repeats the same calculations.

### To optimize:
Use Memorization (store results) or <br> switch to an iterative (loop-based) approach
